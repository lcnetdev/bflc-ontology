# Overview
Initiated by the Library of Congress, BIBFRAME provides a foundation for the 
future of bibliographic description, both on the web, and in the broader networked 
world that is grounded in Linked Data techniques. A major focus of the initiative 
is to determine a transition path for the MARC 21 formats while preserving a 
robust data exchange that has supported resource sharing and cataloging cost 
savings in recent decades.
